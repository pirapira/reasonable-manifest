# Reasonable Manifest

- We work on reasonable systems.
  * Reasonable systems are systems that can be reasoned about.
  * We build, understand and improve reasonable systems.

### Reasonable Specification
- Reasonable systems require simple and accurate specification,
  * for reasoning about what the system is supposed to do.
- Smaller specification tends to be simpler and easier to test for accuracy.

### Reasonable Implementation
- Reasonable systems are implemented with languages and tools with reasonable specifications,
  * for reasoning about why and how the implementation satisfies the specification.
- Reasonable systems require transparent implementation.
  * Trust on the implementor doesn't substitute reasoning about the implementation.

### Reasoning Tools
- Tools (interactive theorem provers, SMT solvers etc) have enabled us to work on practical, reasonable systems
- Tools do not substitute our understanding.
