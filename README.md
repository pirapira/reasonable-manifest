# Reasonable Engineering Manifesto

## 1. I build, understand and improve reasonable systems.

1.1. Reasonable systems can be reasoned about.

1.1.1. Reasonable systems require simple and accurate specification.

1.1.1.1. If the specification of a system doesn't fit in my mind, the system is not reasonable for me.

1.1.1.1.1. Therefore, I do not use the word we in this manifesto. I don't know how to tell whether a specification fits in our minds. I might be able to tell whether a specification fits in my mind.

1.1.2. Reasonable systems require transparent implementation.

1.1.2.1. Reasonable systems are implemented with languages and tools that have reasonable specifications.

1.1.3. The implementation of reasonable systems can be bigger than what fits in my mind.

1.1.3.1. When the implementation is bigger than what fits in my mind, some bookkeeping mechanism is needed to keep track of the gab between the implementation and the specification.

1.2. For me to improve systems built by others, sometimes certain legal arrangements are needed.

1.2.1. Especially for me to publish the improved systems.

## 2. Reasoning tools have enabled us to engineer reasonable systems that are practically useful.

2.1. Reasoning tools have enabled us to work on big implementations, as long as their behavior is defined for the reasoning tools.

2.2. Reasoning tools do not replace my understanding.

## 3. Criticism

3.1. Is this manifesto reasonable?

3.1.1. Is Markdown a reasonable format?

3.2. Should building be placed before understanding and improving?
