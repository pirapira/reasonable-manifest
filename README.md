# Reasonable Engineering Manifesto

1. I build, understand and improve reasonable systems.
1.1. Reasonable systems can be reasoned about.
1.1.1. Reasonable systems require simple and accurate specification.
1.1.1.1. If the specification of a system doesn't fit in my mind, the system is not reasonable for me.
1.1.2. Reasonable systems require transparent implementation.
1.1.2.1. Reasonable systems are implemented with languages and tools that have reasonable specifications.
2. Reasoning tools have enabled us to engineer reasonable systems that are practically useful.
2.1. Reasoning tools do not replace our understanding and communication.
