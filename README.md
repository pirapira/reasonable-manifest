# Reasonable Engineering Manifesto

1. We build, understand and improve reasonable systems.
2. Reasonable systems are systems that can be reasoned about.
3. Reasonable systems require simple and accurate specification.
4. Smaller specification tends to be simpler and easier to get accurate.
5. Reasonable systems are implemented with languages and tools with reasonable specifications.
6. Reasonable systems require transparent implementation.
7. Reasoning tools (interactive theorem provers, SMT solvers etc) have enabled us to work on practical, reasonable systems.
8. Reasoning tools do not substitute our understanding and communication.
